# portfolia-with-bootstrap

## Project Directions

This About Me portfolio project has 3 pages which are index.html, portfolio html and contact.html. 

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. It will work on sites, mobile devices and a personal computer.
 Also used semantic html elements and media queries on the html and css files.

  **Used Bootstrap, develop the portfolio site with the following items:**

   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout form
   * Responsive images
   * footer
   * sub-rows, sub-columns
